# Restaurant Roulette
An app which chooses a restaurant to eat at, based on a different search criteria.

## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, yelp API, google API, zipWise API, firebase, slack, git

## Getting Started
Once you open the heroku app link (https://pure-atoll-60901.herokuapp.com/), you will be taken to the main page on either the mobile or the web platform. From there, you can enter some search parameters including location, radius, price, rating and of course, cuisine if you so choose. If you don't add search criteria, default parameters will be put into the search to return a random restaurant. If the search criteria fails to yeild a result you will be prompted to change your parameters.
